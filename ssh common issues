common ssh connection issues

「 Request timed out 」
代表the server didn't respond to the client and the client program gave up (timed out).
可能是以下的問題造成：
1. The security group or network ACL doesn't allow access.
2. There is a firewall on the instance's operating system.
3. There is a firewall between the client and the server.
4. The host doesn't exist.


「 Connection refused 」
代表封包已經抵達server端，但最後被server端擋掉
可能是以下問的問題造成：
1. The host reached the instance but there was no service listening on the SSH port.
2. A firewall blocked and was set to reject the package instead of dropping it.
